Kouyou
------------

**Kouyou** is a japanese word meaning **utility**, as the word itself implies, is a python package with every **util** code made by me, used in personal projects.

Motivation
-------------

Have you ever wonder "how was that code to that thing I'm used to put in every project", and then, you end writing the same code, over and over again, so in every project you have that piece of code.

Well, this is the WHY of this package. Every time I think this, then I wonder next "what if I put this on a single package and import everytime, instead of "overrepeating" it?". This is how kouyou was born. My personal utils (replicated code) turned into a package.

**Kouyou is part of the Zaidan project** (Link to Zaidan incoming)
